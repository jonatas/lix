Exploring command line with elixir.

    mix run bin/term.ex

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add lix to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:lix, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure lix is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:lix]]
        end
